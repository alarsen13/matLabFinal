Our GUI should be relatively self explanatory as long as 
the input files have the correct format. There should be 
anywhere from one to three input files, each file should
have atleast two collunms of input values. Otherwise it can
have up to six collumn pairs of input values. Once the 
GUI is ran, the values can be graphed and changed with
the buttons and scrollbar. The scroll bar will change the 
collumns of the csv that are read and graphed. The buttons
on the left hand side will change the csv file and pull
values from a different file. The animate button can also 
be used, which will automatically scroll through the whole
scroll bar, showing all of the collumns in one csv on the
graph one at a time.
